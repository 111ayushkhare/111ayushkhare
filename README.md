### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

As a technology enthusiast, I have experience in back-end technologies like Spring Boot and Node.js. I have also worked on native Android development in Kotlin and cross-platform frameworks like Flutter. While I have yet to work with front-end web frameworks, I am eager to expand my skillset by exploring more of JavaScript. Additionally, I have a strong interest in cybersecurity.
